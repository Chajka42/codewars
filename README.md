some of my solutions to [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Chajka) exercises
1) kata1 - Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.
2) kata2 - An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.
3) kata3 - Write a function that accepts two square (NxN) matrices (two dimensional arrays), and returns the product of the two. Only square matrices will be given.
4) kata4 - Given an n x n array, return the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.
5) kata5 - Create a RomanNumerals class that can convert a roman numeral to and from an integer value. It should follow the API demonstrated in the examples below. Multiple roman numeral values will be tested for each helper method.
6) kata6 - There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!
7) kata7 - Write a function validSolution/ValidateSolution/valid_solution() that accepts a 2D array representing a Sudoku board, and returns true if it is a valid solution, or false otherwise. The cells of the sudoku board may also contain 0's, which will represent empty cells. Boards containing one or more zeroes are considered to be invalid solutions.
8) kata8 - Define a regular expression which tests if a given string representing a binary number is divisible by 5.
